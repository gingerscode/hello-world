Just another repository LOL
I'm from SAT2 in San Marcos TX. I would really love to pass this class, so if I ask a lot of questions bare with me. This is all NEW, like BRAND NEW. I feel like I'm trying to learn Portuguese or something. Does anyone else from anywhere find it hard to balance 10 hours of work and then school, or is it just me.
